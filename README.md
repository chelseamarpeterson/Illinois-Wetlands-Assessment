# Illinois-Wetlands-Assessment
Public repository for data files and R code used to quantify area of unprotected non-WOTUS Illinois wetlands and evaluate potential impacts on vulnerable communities. The repository is organized by folder, with each representing a separate pre-processing or analysis step

## Area_Estimates
Folder with script to estimate non-WOTUS wetland area as a function of the wetland flood frequency. It also generates plots for the non-WOTUS wetland area by reason for lack of federal jurisdiction, protection level, and Cowardin wetland type. Another folder contains non-WOTUS and protected wetland area estimates from previous studies:
